# Image to ASCII - C++
This tool converts images to ASCII of a specified width.

It uses `stb_image.h` from the [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) collection to load images as an array of RGBA values. Therefore, it quite effortlessly supports multiple image formats.

I also made a version of this in Haskell: https://github.com/KojoBailey/image-to-ascii-hs
